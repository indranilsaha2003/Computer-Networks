Write a Java program to implement a UDP-based Time Client-Server system.

The server should listen for incoming requests from clients on port 1234.
Upon receiving a request, the server should send the current system time back to the client.
The client should send a request to the server and display the received time.
The server should log the client's IP address and port upon receiving a request.
The program should handle timeouts in case the server does not respond.
